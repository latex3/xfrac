# `xfrac`: Split level fractions

Release 2024-06-04

## Overview

The `xfrac` package uses the interface defined by LaTeX templates to provide
flexible split-level fractions _via_ the `\sfrac` macro. This is both a
demonstration of the power of the template concept and also a useful addition
to the available functionality in LaTeX2e.
